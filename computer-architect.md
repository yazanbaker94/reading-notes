## computers are changing the world and everywhere 

## we use tech daily


## how do computers work?


## what makes a computer?



## how info is represtented?

## different parts of computer


## what code is



## tools are made to solve problems

## inventions to remove manual work

## machine can help us in thinking. solving equations


## machines needed to manipulate info.

## 4 diff tasks to make a computer:

* take input
* store info
* process info
* output info



## computers were as big as rooms

## computers were basic calcs

## now we can use them to play games or control robots




## types of input:

* keyboard
* mouse
* xbox controller


## storage:

* info stored in memory
* takes info from memory and then changes it and sends it back


## output:

* videos 
* text
* games
* signals



## computers work on ones and zeros


## wires and cirtuits carries all electrictiy

## electric current can create yes or no

## binary is 0/1

## any number can be represtnted by 0 or 1s


## 32 wires can store from 0 to billion numbers


## types of info can be saved:

* text
* images 
* etc.

## colors can be represtnted by numbers


## waveform can be saved as numbers



## circuits take signal ON or off

## multiple signals can be combined and if both signals are 0 then result is 0


## you can make an adder circuit where it adds both numbers. you can make more than one adder

## 8 bit add adder adds by giving signals into the circuit


## circuits can make substraction/division/multiplications


## computer calculations can be made by humans but computers are faster

## smaller computers are quick because circuits are smaller too




## input converts physical input to binary


## output takes binary and gives out as physical


## such as sensors/microphones


## to display each letter, computers make thousands of instructions


## circuits/plugs etc. are hardware

## software is inside the computer 


## CPU is the masterchip that controls other computer hardware

## it has circuits to make simple math to send and receie

## CPU knows which commands to do

## CPU tells cirucuit to add, then sends to memory

## binary commands stored in memory

## binary code controls all hardwares


## programming languages is changed to binary

## operating system manages how software controls the hardware

## OS controls all software
