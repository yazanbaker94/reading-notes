# You can evaluate a situation by comparing one value in the script to what you expect it might be. The result will be a Boolean: true or fasle


## evaluating the condition. Conditions can be much more complex than those shown here, but they usually result in a value of true or false.

## comparison operators usually return single values of true or false.
## Logical operators allow you to compare the results of more than one comparison operator.


## Loops check a condition, if it returns true, a code block will run.
## Then the condition will be checked again and if it still returns true, the code block will run again. It repeats until the condition returns false. 
## There are three common types of loops:
## for, while, do while

## A for loop uses a counter as a condition.
## This instructs the code to run a specified number of times.
## Here you can see the condition is made up of three statements: 
## Initilization, condition and update
