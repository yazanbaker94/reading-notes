#Growth Mindset
Growth Mindset is a way of thinking and a more specifically a pattern of thinking.
Growth Mindset is a way of life where as an individual, if you face any problem, you should tackle it and challenge it insted of avoiding it and ignoring it, or as some mindset professionals call it "running from the problem".

Growth Mindset focues on different ways to solve issues and problems by actively looking for solutions and actively facing challenges in order to eventually find solutions to the problems.

If a person needs to grow in his career, life, social skills and all other skills, he will need to adapt a mindset of improving himself.

There are many ways that a person can adapt in his life in order better himself.
There are 3 ways that I use to improve myself:


##Challenges:
Whenever I face a new challenge, I look at it in a way to fix it. 
First of all, I start looking at the type of problem we're facing, then I start looking for solutions. 
The best way to find a solution is to ask someone who already fixed it beforehand, and usually we can find that on google.com/stackoverflow.com


##Effort:
Usually, whenever I face a challenge, it requires a huge amount of effort and energy to fix the issue. Therefore, if we don't exert the proper amount of energy, we will definitely not be able to breakthrough.
Therefore, even if we lose our energy/effort, we can always take a break to regain more energy and come back and tackle it and usually it will be fixed.

##Criticism
If we receive any criticism, we should always welcome it as a positive type of criticism and try to work with it in fixing our problems. We should never take it as a personal insult and never take it emotionally.
