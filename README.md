#What is Markdown?


*Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.*

You can use Markdown most places around GitHub:

Gists
Comments in Issues and Pull Requests
Files with the .md or .markdown extension


You can use '#' for headlines, '*' for unordered lists ie bullet points, 1. for numbered lists and many more.

For example, for images we can use: 

"![GitHub Logo](/images/logo.png)
Format: ![Alt Text](url)"

for links:

"http://github.com - automatic!
[GitHub](http://github.com)"

for black quotes:

"As Kanye West said:

> We're living the future so
> the present is our past."


We can make tables like this


"First Header | Second Header
------------ | -------------
Content from cell 1 | Content from cell 2
Content in the first column | Content in the second column"
