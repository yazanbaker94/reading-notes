# JAVASCRIPT HELPS

## ACCESS CONTENT

## MODIFY CONTENT 

* You can use JavaScript to add
elements, attributes, and text to the
page, or remove them



## PROGRAM RULES

You can specify a set of steps for
the browser to follow (like a recipe),
which allows it to access or change the
content of a page. For example:

## REACT TO EVENTS

## You can specify that a script should run
when a specific event has occurred. For
example, it could be run when:


* A button is pressed
* A link is clicked (or tapped) on
* A cursor hovers over an element
* Information is added to a form
* An interval of time has passed
* A web page has finished loading 

## Access the content of the page
Modify the content of the page
Program rules or instructions the browser can follow
React to events triggered by the user or browser 


* SLIDESHOWS
* FORMS

* RELOAD PART OF PAGE 
* FILTERING DATA 


1. . The script is triggered when the button is clicked.
2. It collects the name entered into the form field.
3. It checks that the user has entered a value.
4. If the user has not entered anything, a message
will appear telling them to enter a name.
5. If a name has been entered, calculate the cost of
the sign by multiplying the number of letters by
the cost per letter.
6. Show how much the plaque costs.




* A script is a series of instructions that the computer
can follow in order to achieve a goal.
Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of
all the instructions.
* Computers approach tasks in a different way than
humans, so your instructions must let the computer
solve the task prggrammatically.
* To approach writing a script, break down your goal into
a series of tasks and then work out each step needed
to complete that task (a flowchart can help).
